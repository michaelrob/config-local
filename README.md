## Config-local -- my configs and scripts

### About

These are the configs and scripts that I use. Mostly when setting up a new machine.

For the most part these are all dev related packages for various languages that I
play with. Remembering install information is the worst.

Also listed is some common information that I need for mysql and other packages.

# Installation

The installation script will copy each script in the project to its location on the
system, if this is no ideal for you simply change the directory in the script.

To run:

`ruby config-local.rb`
