## Config-local -- my configs and scripts

### About

These are the configs and scripts that I use. Mostly when setting up a new machine.

For the most part these are all dev related packages for various languages that I
play with. Remembering install information is the worst.

Also listed is some common information that I need for mysql and other packages.
